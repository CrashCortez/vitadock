Note the VitaDock is also a BT receiver, and will act as such sending sound to your tv (tested with iPhone and Android phone).  

Note the BT on the vita is old closer the vita is to the dock the better the sound quality. This might impact sound on the desktop, since the VitaDock is essentially a BT speaker. 

There is some latency, yes, and I would not use it for a fps competition, but I was able to play Dragon's Lair with a PS4 controller. [Watch Test Video](https://youtu.be/j-mcQHRgISE)

This has been fully tested on the pi3b+ and the pi3a+ with a "Fat" PS Vita and Xerpi's 1.4 UCDC and his PS4 controller plugin from auto plugin vpk. 

On my setup with an el gato capture card, I could not capture a good video. It was jumpy and sound was bad on the video. The VitaDock preformed perfectly even if the capture was bad.  Others have had no issues witch video/audio captures. 

---------------
Huge thank you to the original VitaDock team: Bu (m0tie), ZoidBerg, and his wife Si (icon and video), David-OX, SilentNight and Crash. 

Special thanks to Xerpi (UCDC_UVC plugin, DS3 and DS4 plguins) and TheFlow (MiniVitaTV). For with out their work none of this would be possible.
